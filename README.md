Python program to draw graph bars in the command line.

Configurable (by modifying the code :) ):

- width, height
- char used to draw every bar
- labels, values, percentages are shown or not

In this version, data to graph is specified using a csv text file in the form:

label;value

Ej.:

apple;50
banana;75
peach;30
orange;45.3
lemon;60

The name of the file must be "data.csv" and the delimiter must be ";"
